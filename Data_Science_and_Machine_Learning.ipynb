Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It    supports multipleprogramming paradigms,including structure (particularly procedural),object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python was created byGuido van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991. While you may know the python as a large snake, the name of the Python programming language comes from an old   BBC   television   comedy   sketch   series   calledMonty  Python’s  Flying  Circus.Guido   van Rossumbegan  working  on  Python  in  the  late  1980s  as  a  successor  to  theABC  programming languageandfirst released it in 1991 as Python0.9.0.Python2.0 was released in 2000. Python3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completelybackward-compatiblewith earlier versions. Python2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python2.Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.\n",

Usually, new programming  languages  are  developed  and  published  by  large  companies  employing  lots  of professionals, and due to copyright rules, it is very hard to name any of the people involved in the project. Python is an exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, Guido van Rossum did not develop and evolve all the Python components himself. The speed  with  which  Pythonhas  spread  around  the  world  is  a  result  of  the  continuous  work  of thousands (very often anonymous) programmers, testers, users (many of them aren’t IT specialists) and enthusiasts, but it must be said that the very first idea (the seed from which Python sprouted) came to one head –Guido’s.\n",

        "\n",
        "Keras is a high-level neural networks library written in Python. It is designed to be user-friendly, modular, and extensible, making it an excellent choice for implementing deep learning models. Keras provides a simple and intuitive interface to build, train, and evaluate neural networks, abstracting away the complexities of lower-level frameworks like TensorFlow or Theano.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some key features of the Keras library:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. User-Friendly API: Keras offers a user-friendly and intuitive API that allows you to quickly build and prototype neural networks. It provides a set of high-level building blocks called \"layers\" that can be easily combined to create complex neural network architectures. With Keras, you can define a neural network by simply stacking the layers together.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Modular and Extensible: Keras follows a modular design philosophy, allowing you to easily mix and match different layers, loss functions, and optimizers to create custom neural network architectures. It provides a wide range of pre-built layers and utilities, making it easy to experiment with different configurations and adapt models to various tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Multi-Backend Support: Keras supports multiple backend frameworks, including TensorFlow, Theano, and Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK). This means you can choose the backend that best suits your needs or seamlessly switch between backends without modifying your code. TensorFlow has become the default backend for Keras since its integration with TensorFlow 2.0.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Deep Learning Building Blocks: Keras provides a rich set of building blocks for deep learning, including various types of layers (dense, convolutional, recurrent, etc.), activation functions, regularization techniques, and optimization algorithms. These components can be easily combined to create complex architectures for tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Easy Model Training and Evaluation: Keras simplifies the training and evaluation process by providing high-level functions and utilities. It offers a range of loss functions, metrics, and callbacks that can be used during the training process. Keras also supports GPU acceleration, allowing you to leverage the computational power of GPUs to train models faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Pre-Trained Models and Transfer Learning: Keras provides access to a collection of pre-trained models that have been trained on large datasets. These models can be used as a starting point for your own tasks or as feature extractors in transfer learning scenarios. This enables you to benefit from state-of-the-art architectures and weights without the need for extensive training.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Integration with TensorFlow and Ecosystem: With its integration with TensorFlow, Keras benefits from TensorFlow's computational graph capabilities and ecosystem. This allows you to leverage the powerful TensorFlow features while enjoying the simplicity and ease of use of Keras.\n",
